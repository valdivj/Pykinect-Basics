# Pykinect Video basics

These programs show some basic video functions with the Kinect V2 and PykinecT2.
You have to have the Kinect API installed for the KinectV2.
I belive that this only works on windows PC,s

1.Kinect ColorXY.py: Is just the color stream from the Kinect. 
If you left and right click on the video stream you get back the X,Y cordinates and the RGB values of the pixel clicked on.

2.Kinect Depth XY.py: Is just the depth stream from the Kinect. 
If you left and right click on the depth stream you get back the X,Y cordinates and the depth values of the pixel clicked on.

3.Kinect record.py: Records both the Video stream as .MP4 and the depth stream as a pickle file.
Make sure to set youre path to where you want the files stored

4.Kinect Player.py: Plays back the recorded Video stream and the depth stream at the same time.
Make sure to set youre path to where you the files stored.
If you left and right click on the video stream you get back the X,Y cordinates and the RGB values of the pixel clicked on.
If you left and right click on the depth stream you get back the X,Y cordinates and the depth values of the pixel clicked on.

5.Kinect Depth&Color.py: Is the color and depth stream live feed at the same time.
